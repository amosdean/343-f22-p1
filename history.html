				<h2>The History of Coffee</h2>
				<p><img src="images/shop.jpg" alt="Coffee shop" height=230>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from
					roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. The genus Coffea is
					native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the
					Comoros, Mauritius, and RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean. The plant was exported from Africa to Arabia
					and to countries around the world. Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily
					in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly
					grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and hardier robusta.
					Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as
					beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and
					brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.
				</p>
				<p>
					Coffee is slightly acidic and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine
					content. Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in
					a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, cafe latte, etc.). It is usually served hot,
					although iced coffee is an alternative way of the drink to be served. Clinical studies indicate that
					moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing
					research on whether long-term consumption inhibits cognitive decline during aging or lowers the risk
					of some forms of cancer.

					The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle
					of the 15th century in Sufi shrines. It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and
					brewed in a similar way to how it is now prepared. Coffee seeds were first exported from East Africa
					to Yemen, as the coffea arabica plant is thought to have been indigenous to the former. Yemeni
					traders took coffee back to their homeland and began to cultivate the seed. By the 16th century, it
					had reached Persia, Turkey, and North Africa. From there, it spread to Europe and the rest of the
					world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Coffee is a major export commodity: it is the top agricultural export for numerous countries and is
					among the world's largest legal agricultural exports. It is one of the most valuable commodities
					exported by developing countries. Green (unroasted) coffee is one of the most traded agricultural
					commodities in the world. Some controversy is associated with coffee cultivation and the way
					developed countries trade with developing nations and the impact of its cultivation on the
					environment, in regards to the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use. Consequently, the
					markets for fair trade coffee and organic coffee are expanding.
