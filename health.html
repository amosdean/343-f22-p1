				<h3>Though researchers don't always know exactly which of coffee's ingredients are responsible for
					producing their studies' health-boosting results, there's evidence that drinking coffee may help do
					the following:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Protect against Type 2 diabetes.</strong> A 2014 study by Harvard researchers published
						in the journal Diabetologica tracked nearly 124,000 people for 16–20 years. Those who increased
						their coffee intake by more than a cup a day over a four-year period had an 11 percent lower
						risk of developing Type 2 diabetes; those who decreased their intake by one cup per day had a 17
						percent higher risk of developing the disease.</li>
					<li><strong>Control Parkinson's disease symptoms.</strong> A number of studies have suggested that
						consuming caffeine can reduce your risk of developing Parkinson's disease — and research
						published in 2012 in the journal of the American Academy of Neurology showed that a daily dose
						of caffeine equivalent to that found in two eight-ounce cups of black coffee can help to control
						the involuntary movements of people who already have the disease. (You'd have to drink nearly
						eight cups of brewed black tea to get the same amount of caffeine.)</li>
					<li><strong>Slow the progress of dementia.</strong> In a 2012 study published in the Journal of
						Alzheimer's Disease, Florida researchers tested the blood levels of caffeine in older adults
						with mild cognitive impairments, which can be a precursor to severe dementia, including
						Alzheimer's disease.When they re-evaluated the subjects two to four years later, those whose
						blood levels contained caffeine amounts equivalent to about three cups of coffee were far less
						likely to have progressed to full-blown dementia than those who had consumed little or no
						caffeine.</li>
					<li><strong>Safeguard the liver.</strong> Several studies published in respected journals have found
						that coffee drinking has beneficial effects on the liver, including reducing the risk of death
						from liver cirrhosis, decreasing harmful liver enzyme levels and limiting liver scarring in
						people who have hepatitis C.</li>
					<li><strong>Promote heart health.</strong> In 2013, the journal Epidemiology and Prevention
						published a review of studies analyzing the correlation between coffee consumption and
						cardiovascular disease. Data from 36 different studies showed that people who drink three to
						five cups of coffee per day had a lower risk of heart disease than those who drink no coffee or
						more than five cups per day. While the reason isn't clear, one possibility is that coffee helps
						to improve blood vessels' control over blood flow and blood pressure.</li>
					<li><strong>Reduce melanoma risk.</strong> A recent study appearing in the Journal of the National
						Cancer Institute looked at the coffee-drinking habits of more than 447,000 people over 10 years.
						The researchers found that those who drank four or more cups of caffeinated coffee each day had
						a 20 percent lower risk of developing melanoma than people who drank decaffeinated coffee or no
						coffee.</li>
